# My Journey at Renuo

## Introduction 🌟
Renuo AG is a medium-sized company located in the beautiful municipality of Wallisellen, near the city of Zürich. I joined this amazing family in September 2022, at the age of 23, and I am very grateful to be part of such a wonderful company.

The secret of Renuo's success lies in its partners—amazing people with a clear and inspiring vision on how to run a company. Fairness, transparency, and responsibility are among the many values taught and daily applied at Renuo. Speaking of responsibilities, my job at Renuo was to work on a Swisscom project called Renovero.

## Key Projects and Achievements 🏆

Renovero is a Swiss platform designed to help users find tasks for craftsmen. Users can post jobs on the platform, and certified companies will send them quotes for the job. I joined the Renovero team as a backend engineer, and over time, my role became increasingly influential. Here are some of the key features I worked on:

- **Database Optimization**: I split the database into master and read replicas to avoid downtimes due to high workload, enhancing the platform's reliability.
- **Data Integration**: Led the development of a custom integration to import companies' data from Localsearch, optimizing the server's workload.
- **Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade**: Spearheaded the strategy for upgrading the Kubernetes cluster, which avoided downtimes and outages while improving the infrastructure setup.
- **Salesforce Integration**: Conceptualized and implemented the integration of the platform with Salesforce, fully automating the process of importing contracts and boosting operator efficiency.
- **AWS EKS Cluster Maintenance**: Maintained and optimized the platform's infrastructure on their AWS EKS cluster.
- **Social Login Implementation**: Added social login features to reduce customer friction during login.
- **Elasticsearch Configuration**: Configured and maintained an integration with Elasticsearch to boost contractors' search experience and word search capabilities.
- **AI Integration and LLMs**: As a tech lead, I supervised the integration of AI on Renovero, working with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the platform's capabilities. Implemented machine learning models to personalize user experience and improve search algorithms.
- **Embedded Models Experiments**: Conducted experiments with embedded models on Elasticsearch to further improve the search experience for our customers.
- **Technical Debt Reduction**: Constantly worked to reduce technical debt, keeping the codebase monitored daily to ensure high performance and maintainability.
- **Code Quality Procedures**: Introduced procedures to raise and ensure high code quality on each pull request, including the implementation of static code analysis tools.
- **Complex Infrastructure Management**: Managed the complex infrastructure of Renovero, which spans multiple services and two major cloud providers, GCP and AWS.

In March 2023, I suggested an approach to implement AI on Renovero that was accepted by the CEO and implemented the following year.

In May 2024, due to the dedication I put into the project and my deep understanding of the business and the project, I became the tech lead of the Renovero project at Renuo.

### Project Presentation Writer: Adding Magic to Presentations ✨
Another exciting project I followed at Renuo is Presentation Writer, an AI Assistant that enhances presentations. This tool looks at your camera and allows you to draw on the screen you’re presenting on. It serves as an assistant during presentations, adding a magic touch and impressing your listeners.

## Additional Responsibilities 🔧

At Renuo, I also had other responsibilities, such as configuring meeting room equipment and leading the process of hiring a new team member for our team. What I appreciate most is the fact that Renuo has allowed me to develop a 360-degree skill set.

## Professional Development and Company Culture 🌱

One of Renuo's key values is togetherness and exploring new ways. I loved the close cooperation always experienced within the company. Renuo encouraged continuous learning and professional growth, and I invested time in attending various conferences and workshops, with a focus on AI and emerging technologies. This commitment to learning helped me stay at the forefront of technological advancements and brought new insights to my work.

## Conclusion 🎓

Reflecting on my time at Renuo, I am proud of the contributions I made and the skills I developed. The experiences and achievements during this period have significantly shaped my professional journey, preparing me for future challenges and opportunities. I look forward to applying the knowledge and expertise gained at Renuo to new and exciting projects in my career.
